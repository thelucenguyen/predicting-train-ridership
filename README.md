# üìà Ridership Prediction App

An interactive web application that demonstrates time series passenger count prediction using non-linear additive models. Originally developed for Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority by Lucille E. Nguyen, this implementation translates the statistical methodology into modern web technologies.

## üöÄ Live Demo

Deploy this app to Vercel for instant access to the interactive ridership prediction guide.

## üìä Overview

This application provides a step-by-step interactive guide for:

1. **Understanding Time Series Data** - Learn about temporal dependencies and structural breaks
2. **Granger Causality Testing** - Determine which historical periods can predict future ridership
3. **Optimal Lag Selection** - Use statistical criteria (AIC, BIC, HQ) to choose model parameters
4. **Prophet Forecasting** - Implement Facebook's Prophet algorithm for non-linear predictions
5. **Results Interpretation** - Apply forecasts to transportation planning and operations

## üéØ Key Features

- **Interactive Visualizations** - Dynamic charts showing COVID-19's impact on ridership
- **Statistical Computing** - Browser-based implementation of Granger tests and lag selection
- **Prophet Implementation** - Simplified version of Facebook's forecasting algorithm

npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## üìö Methodology

### Statistical Foundation

The application implements several key statistical concepts:

**Granger Causality Testing**
- Tests whether one time series can predict another
- Uses F-statistics and p-values for hypothesis testing
- Warns against interpreting results as true causation

**Lag Selection Criteria**
- Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
- Schwarz/Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 
- Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion (HQ)
- Final Prediction Error (FPE)

**Prophet Forecasting**
- Non-linear trend modeling
- Automatic seasonality detection
- Uncertainty quantification with confidence intervals
- Robust handling of missing data and outliers

### COVID-19 Impact Analysis

The application specifically addresses the unique challenges of post-pandemic ridership forecasting:

- **Structural Breaks** - How COVID-19 created permanent changes in travel patterns
- **Stochastic Shocks** - Understanding unprecedented disruptions to time series
- **Recovery Modeling** - Capturing gradual return to service while acknowledging new baseline

## üéì Educational Use

This application is designed for:

- **Transportation Planners** - Learn practical forecasting methods
- **Data Scientists** - Understand time series analysis in transportation context
- **Students** - Interactive statistics and machine learning concepts
- **Researchers** - Explore post-pandemic mobility patterns

## üìä Data Sources & Examples

The application includes:

- **Simulated Capitol Corridor Data** - Weekly ridership 2019-2023
- **COVID-19 Impact Visualization** - Dramatic ridership drops and recovery
- **Interactive Parameter Selection** - Experiment with different model settings
- **Forecast Scenarios** - Generate predictions with uncertainty bounds

## üîß Customization

### Adding Your Own Data

1. Modify `lib/statistics.ts` to import your ridership data
2. Update the `generateSampleRidershipData()` function
3. Adjust seasonal patterns and trend components as needed

### Extending Statistical Methods

1. Implement additional information criteria
2. Add more sophisticated Prophet parameters
3. Include external regressors (holidays, events, weather)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

### Statistical Limitations

- **Granger "Causality"** - Tests prediction utility, not true causation
- **Model Assumptions** - Prophet assumes additive seasonality and trend
- **Uncertainty Bounds** - Based on historical patterns, may not capture unprecedented events

### Practical Applications

- Results should be validated with domain expertise
- Consider external factors (economic conditions, policy changes, infrastructure)
- Update models regularly as new data becomes available
- Use multiple forecasting methods for robust predictions
